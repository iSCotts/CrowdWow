<b><font color="#0099CC" size="+2">We make invention accessible.</font></b><br /><br />
<p><font size="+1">For centuries, becoming an inventor has been a<br /> hard gig to crack. Complexities relating to <br />financing, engineering, distribution, and legalities<br /> have stood in the way of brilliant people executing<br /> on their great ideas.</p>

<p><font size="+1">Since launching in 2009, Quirky has rapidly<br /> changed the way the world thinks about product<br /> development.</p>

<p><font size="+1">We bring two brand new consumer products to<br /> market each week, by enabling a fluid conversation<br /> between a global community and Quirky's expert<br /> product design staff.</p>

<p><font size="+1">The world influences our business in real-time,<br /> and we share our revenue directly with the people<br /> who helped us make successful decisions.</p>
