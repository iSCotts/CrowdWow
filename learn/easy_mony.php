						So for your reference, in case you’re new to the product game, we have a little story for you.

<p style="font-size:14px; color:#666666">
						When Ben started his first company to sell the Song Sling for the iPod Shuffle, he invested $185k to get things rolling. The product retailed for $40, and he sold 10,000 units, leaving the company with over $100k in debt. Ouch. 
</p>
<p style="font-size:14px; color:#666666">

						But remember, Ben had to set up a company, pay out for tooling, manufacturing, marketing, sales force, travel, building a website, etc. In comparison, had Ben-then known that Ben-now would come up with quirky, well, he could have launched the Song Sling here and with even just 10% influence, he would have earned $12,000. And being in the black is so much cooler.
